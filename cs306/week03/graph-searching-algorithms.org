* Depth-First

#+BEGIN_VERSE
  *ALGORITHM* /DFS(G)/
  //// Implements a depth-first search traversal of a given graph
  //// Input: Graph /G = <V,E>/
  //// Output: Graph /G/ with its vertices marked with consecutive integers
  //// in the order they are first encountered by the DFS traversal
  mark each vertex in /V/ with 0 as a mark of being "unvisited"
  /count \leftarrow 0/
  *for* each vertex /v/ in /V/ *do*
      *if* /v/ is marked with 0
          /dfs(v)/
#+END_VERSE

#+BEGIN_VERSE
  /dfs(v)/
  //// visits recursively all the unvisited vertices connected to vertex /v/
  //// by a path and numbers them in the order they are encountered
  /count \leftarrow count + 1/; mark /v/ with /count/
  *for* each vertex /w/ in /V/ adjacent to /v/ *do*
      *if* /w/ is marked with 0
          /dfs(w)/
#+END_VERSE

* Breadth-First

#+BEGIN_VERSE
  *ALGORITHM* /BFS(G)/
  //// Implements a breadth-first search traversal of a given graph
  //// Input: Graph /G = <V,E>/
  //// Output: Graph /G/ with its vertices marked with consecutive integers
  //// in the order they are visited by the BFS traversal.
  mark each vertex in /V/ with 0 as a mark of being "unvisited"
  /count \leftarrow 0/
  *for* each vertex /v/ in /V/ *do*
      *if* /v/ is marked with 0
          /bfs(v)/
#+END_VERSE

#+BEGIN_VERSE
  /bfs(v)/
  //// visits all the unvisited vertices connected to vertex /v/
  //// by a path and numbers them in the order they are visited
  /count \leftarrow count + 1/; mark /v/ with /count/ and initialize a queue with /v/
  *while* the queue is not empty *do*
      *for* each vertex /w/ in /V/ adjacent to the front vertex *do*
          *if* /w/ is marked with 0
              /count \leftarrow count + 1/; mark /v/ with /count/
              add /w/ to the queue
      remove the front vertex from the queue
