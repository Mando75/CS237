  If you can truthfully assert any of the following, you know what to do. 

  - [X] I followed the presentation in class about comparing set sizes.
  - [X] I was intrigued enough to watch the other numberphile video (the one we
    didn\rsquo{}t watch) on Graham\rsquo{}s number.
  - [X] I will ponder the fact that /any/ gargantuan natural number (e.g.,
    Graham\rsquo{}s number), because it is finite, is \ldquo{}small\rdquo in the sense that /almost
    all/ natural numbers are larger than it.
  - [X] I can articulate the Cantor Diagonalization argument.
  - [X] I know enough about infinity to be dangerous! (Such as where the only
    occurrence of that word is found in all of the Standard Works.)
