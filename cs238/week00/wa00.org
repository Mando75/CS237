  CLOSED: [2018-01-08 Mon 20:43]

  If you can truthfully assert that you did any of the following, put an X in
  the box. (With Spacemacs bindings, putting the cursor anywhere on the line and
  typing , , (two commas) will toggle the X for you.)

  + [x] I got a GitHub account, or I already had one.
  + [x] I found and worked through an introductory GitHub/Git tutorial, or I am
    already GitHub/Git-literate.
  + [x] I obviously signed up for GitHub Classroom, as that is how I got access
    to this file.
  + [x] I (re)read the introductory sections of [[https://rickneff.github.io/metaphors-be-with-you.html][The Book]] (up to and including
    section ONE subsubsection ONI --- just before subsection ABC).

:Feedback:
Use , , to mark the boxes. Do not type an x.

  I think one subtle way the desert can be related to discrete mathematics, and more specifically to this course, is that 
  it is dangerous to traverse alone! It is much better to travel in groups where you can look out for and help one another. 
  In this class, I think we need to band together to enhance each other's learning, and 'safely' traverse the often confusing 
  or immense space discrete mathematics contains.

Patterns:
The results are all even numbers
The results are all divisible by 3
The results are all divisible by 6
The (2x) + 1 terms are the ascending odd numbers
The last digits of the product seem to be following a pattern of 6040060400â€¦
This sequence also represents the area of Pythagorean triangles!!!!

  Bro. Neff told us that we could do this problem as extra credit. 

** Hardy 
   I think that he meant that patterns in mathematics may be 'created' or 'discovered' by mathematicians, 
   but they are rooted in something deeper. Mathematics is one of the natural languages in the world, which
   is why these patterns we 'create' appear in so many places. Just take the Fibonacci Numbers that we examined in class
   today! Humans invented the pattern, named it, and studied it, but elements of that pattern can be found everywhere in nature. 
   This is profound, because it shows that mathematics is truth.

** Introduce Set Cardinality (Size)
   Cardinal: The attribute of a set that is its size. Cardinal means counting ie 1 2 3 
   Ordinal: Order of items ie 1st 2nd 3rd
** Golden quesition to ask computer professionals
   What is the cardinaliity of the power set of a set of size n? 2^n
